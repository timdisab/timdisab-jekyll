I have worked in digital media for many years and have managed online marketing campaigns across a wide spectrum of industries including technology (B2B & B2C), software as a service (SaaS), legal, real estate, education, and e-commerce. Over the years, I have worked with many clients ranging from large, multinational corporations, VC-backed startups, bootstrapped startups all the way down to small businesses.

Aside from working for several digital marketing agencies in the San Francisco Bay Area, I ran my own digital marketing consultancy, Pathways Digital, for seven years where I managed multi-million dollar annual advertising budgets for clients across a range of digital media acquisition channels. Before that, I worked for a digital marketing agency in Silicon Valley, a web design agency and an e-commerce retailer.

In another life, I worked in equity research in securities analysis.  I began my career working on the sell-side for a technology investment bank in San Francisco in the late 1990s (during the heady days of the dot-com boom). Later, I worked on the buy-side for a mutual fund and for an asset management firm in Marin County, CA.

Programming and building web applications is a serious hobby of mine. I wrote my first computer program in the early 1980s in BASIC on a Radio Shack TRS-80. However, I didn’t really begin taking code seriously until the mid-2000s. These days, my programming interests lie mainly in building web applications in Ruby, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript with HTML, CSS (Sass) and Bootstrap on the front-end.

In my non-screen time, I enjoy a multitude of interests including world travel, playing guitar and piano, running, cooking and hiking California’s central coast where I live.  Thanks for visiting my blog.
